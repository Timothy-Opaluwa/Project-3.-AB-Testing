Project Overview:

In this project, the Library of Montana State University has a website that students use to find books and articles.

Below the library picture, there is a search bar and three big items: “Find”, “Request” and “Interact”. All three of them contain access to important information however, the Website Analytics show that the “Interact” button has, ironically, almost no interactions.

The MSU team wants to run a 5-way AB Test. They would like to us to compare the performance of the original button "Interact", to new versions: "Learn", "Help", "Connect", "Services".

The way to measure how each one of the buttons perform is by click-through-rate or CTR.

Using google colab, I did the:

- Data Collection & Cleaning
- Hypothesis Testing
- AB Testing
- Chi-Square Testing
- Bonferroni Adjustment
